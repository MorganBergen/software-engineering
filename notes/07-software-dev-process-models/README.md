## why software engineering

-  software is vital to the us global competitiveness, innovation, and national security
-  also, the us economy, it infrastructure, healthcare, and education depend on software
-  great research opportunities
-  great professional opportunities
    -  be a part of the excitement
    -  fun to develop new products
    -  focus and the recommendations of the course

## a development process

-  a process is a set of activities that are planned and are performed to achieve a given purpose, and includes,
    -  roles and responsibilities
    -  tools
    -  procedures and methods that define how to do the tasks and relationship between the tasks
-  why a process
    -  provides guidelines and a structure
    -  provides for consistency; minimizes redundanies

## software development process

-  when a process involves building a software, the process may be referred to as the software development process
-  four major activities (very broad)
    -  requirements engineering
    -  design
    -  coding / implementation
    -  testing

## activities

-  requirements engineering
    -  requirements analysis
    -  system requirements

## activities may be divided

-  software development activities may be presented as a set of activities
-  requirements engineering
    -  requirements elicitation
    -  requirements analysis
    -  requirements modeling
    -  requirements validation

-  software development activities may be presented as a set of activities 
-  design
    -  architectural design
    -  data structure

## software development models

-  describe the ordering of development activities and the expected artifacts (outcomes) from each activity
-  many development models
    -  planned, disciplined ("linear") models (e.g. the waterfall model)
    -  prototyping model
    -  phased or incremental models (e.g. the unified process models)
