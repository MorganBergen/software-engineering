## review

c programming
- basic data types
- control structures
- arrays

## c++

- c++ a powerful computer programming language that’s appropriate for technically oriented people with little or no programming experience, and for experienced programmers to use in building substantial information systems
- c++ is one of today’s most popular software development languages
- c++ evolved from c, which was developed by Dennis
Ritchie at Bell Laboratories
– c++, an extension of c, was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Laboratories
– c++ provides several features that “spruce up” the c language

## c++ standard library

- c++ programs consist of pieces called classes and functions 
- most c++ programmers take advantage of the rich collectiosn of classes and functions in the standard library
- two parts of learning the c++ world
    - the c++ langauge itself
    - how to use the classes and functions in the c++ standard library
- many special-purpose class libraries are supplied by independent software vendors

## se observations

- use a "building-block" approach to create programs.  avoid reinventing the wheel.  use existing pieces whenever possible.  called software reuse, this practice is central to object-oriented programming.

- when programming in c++, you typically will use the following building blocks, classes and functions from the c++ standard library, classes and function you and your colleagues create and classes and functions from various popular third-parties libraries.

- using c++ standard library functions and classes instead of writing your own version can imporve program perforamce, because they're written carefully to perform efficiently.  this technique also shortens program development time.

## compiled programs

- compiling a high-level language program into machine language can take a considerable amount of computer time
- interpreter programs were developed to execute high- level language programs directly (without the need for compilation), although more slowly than compiled programs
- scripting languages such as the popular web languages JavaScript and PHP are processed by interpreters

**examples of indusry software that uses c++**
- microsoft visual studio
- adobe photoshop
- google chrome
- apple xcode
- microsoft office
- call of duty
- amazon's e-commerce platform
- grand theft auto
- financial trading software such as metatrader
- the XRP ledger - decentralized blockchain that supports the XRP cryptocurrency

## data hierarchy

```
[][][][]
[][][][]  <- file
[][][][]

[][][] <- record
[][][]
[][][]

[][]  <- field
[][]

[]  <- byte (ASCII character)

1 <- bit
```

## key se concepts supported by oo languages

- abstraction
- classes
    - attributes and methods
    - member functions
    - public, private, or protected
- encapsulation
    - information hiding
    - single, double
    - faciliate reusability
- polymorphism
    - overloading
    - overriding
