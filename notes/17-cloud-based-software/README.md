##  cloud computing

-  on demand availability and delivery of computing services
    -  servers
    -  storage
    -  databases
    -  networking
    -  software
    -  analytics

##  cloud based software

-  the cloud is a very large number of remote servers that are offered for rent by companies that own these servers
    -  you can rent as many servers as you need, run your software on these servers, and make them available to your customers
    -  your customers can access these servers from their own computers or other networked devices
    -  you may rent a server and install your own software
    -  you may pay for access to software products that are available on the cloud

##  remote servers

-  remote servers are virtual (implemented in software, not hardware)
-  many virtual servers can run simultaneously on each cloud hardware node
-  very powerful hardware to run multiple virtual servers
    -  performance not affected

-  cloud management software makes it easy to acquire and release servers on demand
-  if you need resources for only a short time, you simply pay for the time that you need
-  this means that software that runs on the cloud can be scalable, elastic, and resilient

##  scailability

-  scalability reflects the ability of your software to cope with increasing numbers of users
-  as the load on your software increases, your software automatically adapts so that the system performance and response time are maintained

##  elasticity 

-  elasticity is related to scalability but also allows for scaling down as well as scaling up
-  that is, you can monitor the demand on your application and add or remove servers dynamically as the number of users changes

##  elasticity vs scalability

-  scalability handles the changing needs of an application
    -  statically adding or removing resources to meet application demands if needed
    -  provisioning new servers to meet static demand growth

-  elasticity to match the resources allocated with the actual number of resources needed at any given point in time 
    -  scalability of the resources (cpu, memory)
