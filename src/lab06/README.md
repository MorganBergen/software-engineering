draw a uml class diagram to fully describe the relationships between year month, week, and day.  note that some months are 31 days, some are 30 days, and february is 28 days

thus if aliens from planet mars visited you at ku, and you gave them your yml diagram, they could fully understand how the calendar system on earth works.
